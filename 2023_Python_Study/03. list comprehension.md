## List Comprehension

- a concise and powerful way to create lists in Python
- allow you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable(e.g., a list, tuple, or range)
- optionally filter the items based on a condition
- a more compact alternative to traditional for loops when you need to create a new list from an existing one
```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```
1. expression: the expression you want to apply to each item in the iterable. it can as as simple or complex as needed
2. item: a variable that represents each element in the iterable as you iterate through it
3. iterable: the source of data that you want to iterate over, such as a list, tuple, or range
4. condition(optional): it is able include an optional condition that filters the items from the iterable. only items that satisfy this condition will be included in the new list
- example 1: creating a list of squares
    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
    print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    ```
- example 2: filtering even number
    ```python
    nubmers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
    print(even_numbers) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    ```
- example 3: using a conditional expression
    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = ["even" if x % 2 == 0 else "odd" for x in numbers]
    print(result)   # Output: ['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd']
    ```
