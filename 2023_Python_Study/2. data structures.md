## Data Structures

### Lists
- for dynamic arrays, stacks, queues
- Lists are ordered collections of items.
- They are created using square brackets [].
- Lists can contain elements of different data types.
- example
    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello", True]
    ```
- common operations
    - accessing elements by index
        - my_list[0] returns the first element
    - slicing
        - my_list[1:3] returns a new list with elements 2 and 3
    - adding elements
        - my_list.append(4) adds 4 to the end
    - removing elements
        - my_list.remove(2) removes the first occurrence of 2

### Tuples
- immutable and can used when ordered collection of itmes are needed
- tuples are similar to lists but immutable(cannot be modified once created)
- they are created using parentheses ()
- tuples can also contain elements of different data types
- example
    ```python
    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "wolrd")
    ```
- common operations
    - accessing elements by index
        - my_tuple[0] returns the first element
    - tuple packing and unpacking
        - x, y = my_tuple

### Dictionaries
- uesful for key-value pair storage and quick lookups
- store data in key-value pairs
- created using curly vraces {} or the dict() constructor
- example
    ```python
    my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
    ```
- common operations
    - accessing values by key
        - my_dict["name"] returns "Alice"
    - adding key-value pairs
        - my_dict["email"] = "alice@exmaple.com"
    - removing key_value pairs
        - del my_dict["age"]

### Sets
- for unique value stroage and set operations
    - set operations: union, intersection, complement, difference, symmetric difference, subset, superset, disjoin sets
- unordered collections of unique elements
- created using curly braces {} or the set()
- example
    ```python
    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
    ```
- common operations
    - adding elements
        - my_set.add(5)
    - removing elements
        - my_set.remove(3)
    - set operations like union, intersection, and difference
        - my_set.union(other_set)

### Strings
- sequences of characters and are used for text processing
- can be created using single, double, or triple quotes
- example
    ```python
    my_string = "Hello, World!"
    ```
- common operations
    - slicing
    - concatenation
    - string methods like split(), strip(), replace()

### Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets Comprehensions
- Python provides a concise way to create these data structures using comprehensions
- comprehensions allow to create new data structures by specifying a set of expressions
- example
    ```python
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
    ```
