## Built-in Functions 

### Basic Functions
- print()
- input()
    ```python
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    ```
    1. Basic Input
        ```python
        name = input("Enter your name: )
        print(f"Hello, {name}!")
        ```
    2. Numeric Input
        - You can use input() to receive numeric input, but you need to convert the input to the desired data type (e.g., int or float).
        ```python
        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
        if age >= 18:
            print("Your are an adult.")
        else:
            print("Your are a minor.")
        ```
    3. Multiple Inputs:
        ```python
        name = input("Enter your name: ")
        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
        print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
        ```
    4. Using input() in a Loop
        ```python
        while True:
            user_input = input("Enter 'quit' to exit: ")
            if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
                break
        ```
    5. Handling Exceptions
        ```python
        try:
            age = int(input("Enter your age: ))
            print(f"You entered {age} yeaers old.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
        ```
    6. Using input() with eval()
        ```python
        expression = input("Enter a mathmatical expression: ")
        result = eval(expression)
        ```
- len(): returns the number of items in an object, such as a string, list, or tuple
    ```python
    length = len("Python")
    ```
- type(): returns the type of an object
    ```python
    x = 5
    t = type(x)
    ```
- int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), set(): used for type conversion between different data types.
    ```python
    x = int("42")
    y = str(3.14)
    ```
- range(): generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range
    ```python
    numbers = list(range(1, 6))  # Generates [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```
- sum(), max(), min(), abs(): perform mathematical operations on data
    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    total = sum(numbers)
    largest = max(numbers)
    ```

### Advanced Functions
- sorted(): returns a sorted version of a list, without modifying the original list.
    ```python
    numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 3]
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    ```
- zip(): combines two or more iterables element-wise.
    ```python
    names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
    scores = [85, 92, 78]
    combined = list(zip(names, scores))
    ```
- map(), filter(): used for functional programming operations on iterable data structures
    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
    even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
    ```
- all(), any(): check if all or any elements of an iterable evaluate to True
    ```python
    nums = [True, True, False, True]
    all_true = all(nums)  # False
    any_true = any(nums)  # True
    ```
- open(): Used to open files for reading or writing.
    ```python
    with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
    ```
- help(): Displays documentation and help for Python objects and modules.
    ```python
    help(list)
    ```
- dir(): lists all attributes and methods of an object.
    - the output of dir() can be quite extensive, especially for complex objects and modules
    - includes both built-in methods and user-defined attributes and methods
    - can use this function to discover what functionality is available for a particular object or module and to aid in debugging and exploration during development
    ```python
    dir(list)
    ```
    1. Built-in Functions and Modules
        - can use dir() to explore the attributes and methods of built-in functions and modules
        ```python
        print(dir(len))  # List attributes and methods of the len function
        import math
        print(dir(math))  # List attributes and functions in the math module
        ```
    2. Data Types
        - can use dir() to examine the methods and attributes available for various data types, such as strings, lists, and dictionaries.
        ```python
        s = "Hello, World!"
        print(dir(s))  # List attributes and methods of a string

        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        print(dir(numbers))  # List attributes and methods of a list
        ```
    3. Custom Classes
        - when you define your own classes, you can use dir() to inspect the attributes and methods of instances of those classes.
        ```python
        class Person:
            def __init__(self, name, age):
                self.name = name
                self.age = age

        person = Person("Alice", 30)
        print(dir(person))  # List attributes and methods of a custom class instance
        ```
    4. Modules and Packages
        - dir() can also be used to explore modules and packages you create or import.
        ```python
        # Assuming you have a custom module named mymodule.py
        import mymodule
        print(dir(mymodule))  # List attributes and functions in your custom module
        ```
    5. Objects with Special Methods:
        - Some objects, such as iterators and context managers, have special methods (e.g., __iter__, __enter__, __exit__) that you can inspect using dir().
        ```python
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        iterator = iter(numbers)
        print(dir(iterator))  # List special methods for an iterator
        ```
    6. Built-in Types and Modules:
        - You can explore the attributes and methods of built-in types and modules, such as list, str, and math.
        ```python
        print(dir(list))  # List attributes and methods of the list type
        print(dir(str))   # List attributes and methods of the str type
        print(dir(math))  # List attributes and functions in the math module
        ```
- eval(): used to dynamically evaluate a single Python expression (a piece of Python code that produces a value) from a string
    1. Basic Mathematical Evaluation:
        ```python
        expression = "2 + 3 * 4"
        result = eval(expression)
        print(result)  # Output: 14
        ```
    2. User Input Evaluation
        ```python
        expression = input("Enter a mathematical expression: ")
        try:
            result = eval(expression)
            print("Result:", result)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error:", e)
        ```
