## Error Handling

- a crucial aspect of writing robust and reliable programs
- involves identifying, handling, and potentially recovering from errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of a Python program
- Errors can occur for various reasons, such as incorrect input, file not found, division by zero, and many others. Python provides several mechanisms for error handling

1. exceptions
    - in Python, errors are represented as exceptions
    - when an error occurs, an exception object is raised, and the program stops executing unless the exception is caught and handled
2. Try-Except Blocks
    - the most common way to handle exceptions is by using try-except blocks
    - enclose the code that might raise an exception within a try block, and you specify the handling code in an except block
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that may raise an exception
    except SomeException:
        # Code to handle the exception
    ```
    - example:
        ```python
        try:
            result = 10 / 0 # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
        except ZeroDivisionError as e:
            pritn(f"Error: {e}")
        ```
3. Multiple Except Blocks
    - can use multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions
    - python allows you to catch and handle different exceptions in separate blocks
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that may raise an exception
    except FirstException:
        # Code to handle the first exception
    except SecondException:
        # Code to handle the second exception
    ```
4. Else Clause
    -  can use an else clause in a try-except block to specify code that should be executed if no exceptions are raised
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that may raise an exception
    except SomeException:
        # Code to handle the exception
    else:
        # Code to execute if no exception is raised
    ```
5. Finally Block
    - the finally block is used to specify code that should be executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not
    - it is commonly used for cleanup operations
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that may raise an exception
    except SomeException:
        # Code to handlethe exception
    finally:
        # Code that always runs, even is an exception was raised
    ```
6. Custom Exceptions
    - can create your own custom exception classes by inheriting from the Exception class or one of its subclasses
    - allows to define specific exceptions tailored to your application
    ```python
    class CustomError(Exception):
        pass
    ```
7. Raising Exceptions
    - can raise exceptions explicitly using the raise statement, allowing you to signal errors or exceptional conditions in your code
    ```python
    if condition:
        raise CustomError("This is a custom error message")
    ```
8. Exception Hierarchy
    - Python has a built-in exception hierarchy with a base class BaseException at the top
    - more specific exception classes are derived from it
    - This hierarchy allows to catch exceptions at different levels of granularity
        - granularity: 세분성. 무언가를 더 작은 단위로 표현하는 것을 말함
9. Common Exception Types
    - Python has several built-in exception types, including ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, and TypeError, among others
    - Understanding these exception types can help you handle errors effectively.
10. Logging
    -  can use the Python logging module to log error messages and other information to a log file or the console, helping with debugging and monitoring
