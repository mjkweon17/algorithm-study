## Python 체득할 techniques

1. string handling
    - string manipulation methods: split(), join(), strip(), replace(), find()
    - formatting methods
        - f-strings: formatted string literals)
        - format(): constructing strings with variables
    - regular expressions: for advanced string manipulation
2. data structures
    - built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
        - lists: for dynamic arrays, stacks, queues
        - dictionaries: uesful for key-value pair storage and quick lookups
        - sets: for unique valuestroage and set operations
            - set operations: union, intersection, complement, difference, symmetric difference, subset, superset, disjoin sets
        - tuples: immutable and can used when ordered collection of itmes are needed
3. list comprehension
    - create compact and readable code for list transformations and filtering using list comprehension
4. error handling
    - try...except blocks
        - IndexError,TypeError, ValueError
5. built-in functions 
    - len(), max(), min(), sum()
6. libraries and modules
    - math, regluar expressions, data manipulation
7. time complexity
    - of list slicing, dictionary lookups,and set operations
8. testing
    - unittest: built-in testing frameworks
    - pytest: third-party libraries
9. documentation and comments
    - use docstrings for functions and comments to explain my code
10. coding style
    - adhere to the PEP 8 style guide
