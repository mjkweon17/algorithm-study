### Python 체득할 techniques

- string handling
    - string manipulation methods: split(), join(), strip(), replace(), find()
    - formatting methods
        - f-strings: formatted string literals)
        - format(): constructing strings with variables
    - regular expressions: for advanced string manipulation
- data structures
    - built-in data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
        - lists: for dynamic arrays, stacks, queues
        - dictionaries: uesful for key-value pair storage and quick lookups
        - sets: for unique valuestroage and set operations
            - set operations: union, intersection, complement, difference, symmetric difference, subset, superset, disjoin sets
        - tuples: immutable and can used when ordered collection of itmes are needed
- list comprehension
